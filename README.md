## General

### DuckFix

This feature removes duck cooldown when spamming `+duck` button.

### Map config

- Support full map name matching. i.e. `mg_test_multigames`
- Support start with any prefix. i.e. `mg_`

#### Usage

Put `***.cfg` to `csgo/cfg/lupercalia/map/` folder

This map config folder will automatically created when not exists.

#### ConVar

In default `lp_mg_mapcfg_type` is 0, which means disabled.

If you want to use exact mach i.e. `de_dust2.cfg` set `lp_mg_mapcfg_type` to 1

Or you want to use partial match i.e. `dust.cfg` set `lp_mg_mapcfg_type` to 2

---

In default `lp_mg_mapcfg_execution_timing` is 1 which means Execute on map start only.

If you want to execute at only round start set `lp_mg_mapcfg_execution_timing` to 2

Or you want to execute at both set `lp_mg_mapcfg_execution_timing` to 3

### EntityOutputHook

This feature like a [BSP ConVar Allower](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2578442)

This module is OFF by default as it is only useful for certain use cases.

For example, when you have a multi-game kind of map with a skate mode, the map will try to change the CVAR of `sv_standable_normal`, but this is usually impossible to change because it is not in the Whitelist + requires `sv_cheats 1`.

So, a workaround can be implemented by utilizing CSSharp's HookEntityOutput

By hooking an arbitrary Entity and executing commands allowed on the server side, it is possible to safely modify a specific CVAR while bypassing the above restrictions.

By default, three Entities are hooked: `logic_auto` `point_servercommand` `func_button` (most maps seem to issue commands via these).

Also, by default, there are no allowed commands, so we need to change and set the CVAR for each map by cfg.

# ConVars / Config

See generated configs in `csgo/cfg/lupercalia/` or [PluginSettings.cs](LupercaliaMGCore/PluginSettings.cs)
